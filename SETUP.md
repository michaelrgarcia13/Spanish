## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API Error"
- Check that your API key is correctly set in `spanish-kiosk-server/.env`
- Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account

### "Microphone not working"
- Make sure you allowed microphone permissions
- Try refreshing the page and allowing permissions again
- On iPhone, this only works with HTTPS (deployed version)

### "Cannot connect to backend"
- Make sure the backend server is running on port 3000
- Check the browser console for network errors
